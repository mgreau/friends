# Elastic

* Elastic is using Tekton Pipeline and Tekton CLI in build and release processes for the Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, Logstash, APM) and Elastic Solutions.
We have significantly improved our promotion and publishing process by using these Tekton projects.

* We utilize the Elastic Stack to observe all the Tekton Pods' metrics and logs.

* We contribute to Tekton development by opening issues and pull requests.
